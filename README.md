**NextSlide** is an online collection and viewer of PowerPoint presentations for large events/conferences with many speakers. You can control these PowerPoints on the web through a mobile phone and/or Pebble smartwatch. These devices also allow you to read quick notes to spark you memory for every slide. Everything is saved on the web so it can be accessed anywhere so event attendees can access the information later on.
